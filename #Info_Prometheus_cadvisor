# Container Monitoring with cAdvisor and Prometheus

This PR introduces container monitoring using cAdvisor and Prometheus. The setup enables detailed monitoring of container performance and resource usage, which is essential for effective management and optimization.

## Overview

- **cAdvisor** is used to collect container-specific metrics.
- **Prometheus** scrapes and stores these metrics from cAdvisor.

## Metrics Collected by cAdvisor

cAdvisor exports a variety of metrics related to container performance:

1. **CPU Usage**
   - Tracks the CPU usage of each service container.

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Monitors memory consumption for each container.

3. **Network Bandwidth and Packet Statistics**
   - Provides information on network traffic, including bandwidth usage and packet counts.

4. **Disk I/O**
   - Measures disk read and write operations, reporting the amount of data read from and written to the disk by each container (in bytes).

5. **File System Usage**
   - Shows how much disk space is occupied by each container's filesystem, including data and metadata.

## How It Works

- **cAdvisor** collects metrics related to CPU, memory, network, disk I/O, and filesystem usage.
- **Prometheus** is configured to scrape data from cAdvisor endpoints at regular intervals.

I faced a problem where i tried changing the internal port map of cadvisor to other than its default 8080 so its must that  the container port for cadvisor  should be 8080.
